# .create materialized-view

A [materialized view](materialized-view-overview.md) is an aggregation query over a source table, representing a single summarize statement.

There are two possible ways to create a materialized view, noted by the *backfill* option in the command:

 * **Create based on the existing records in the source table:** 
      * Creation may take a long while to complete, depending on the number of records in the source table. The view won't be available for queries until backfill is complete.
      * When using this option, the create command must be `async` and execution can be monitored using the [.show operations](../operations.md#show-operations) command.

    * Canceling the backfill process is possible using the [.cancel operation](#cancel-materialized-view-creation) command.

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > Using the backfill option may take a long time to complete for large source tables. If this process transiently fails while running, it will not be automatically retried, and a re-execution of the create command is required. See the [Backfill a materialized view](#backfill-a-materialized-view) section for more details.
    
* **Create the materialized view from now onwards:**
    * The materialized view is created empty, and will only include records ingested after view creation. Creation of this kind returns immediately, doesn't require `async`, and the view will be immediately available for query.

The create operation requires [Database Admin](../access-control/role-based-authorization.md) permissions. The creator of the materialized view becomes the Admin of it.

## Syntax

`.create` [`async`] `materialized-view` <br>
[ `with` `(`*PropertyName* `=` *PropertyValue*`,`...`)`] <br>
*ViewName* `on table` *SourceTableName* <br>
`{`<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Query*<br>`}`

## Arguments

|Argument|Type|Description
|----------------|-------|---|
|ViewName|String|Materialized View name. The view name can't conflict with table or function names in same database and must adhere to the [identifier naming rules](../../query/schema-entities/entity-names.md#identifier-naming-rules). |
|SourceTableName|String|Name of source table that the view is defined on.|
|Query|String|The materialized view query. For more information, see [query](#query-argument).|

### Query argument

The query used in the materialized view argument is limited by the following rules:

* The query argument should reference a single fact table that is the source of the materialized view, include a single summarize operator, and one or more aggregation functions aggregated by one or more groups by expressions. The summarize operator must always be the last operator in the query.

* A view is either an `arg_max`/`arg_min`/`any` view (those functions can be used together in same view) or any of the other supported functions, but not both in same materialized view. 
    For example, `SourceTable | summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *), count() by Id` isn't supported. 

* The query shouldn't include any operators that depend on `now()` or on `ingestion_time()`. For example, the query shouldn't have `where Timestamp > ago(5d)`. A materialized view with an `arg_max`/`arg_min`/`any` aggregation can't include any of the other supported aggregation functions. Limit the period of time covered by the view using the retention policy on the materialized view.

* Composite aggregations are not supported in the materialized view definition. For instance, instead of the following view: `SourceTable | summarize Result=sum(Column1)/sum(Column2) by Id`, define the materialized view as: `SourceTable | summarize a=sum(Column1), b=sum(Column2) by Id`. During view query time, run - `ViewName | project Id, Result=a/b`. The required output of the view, including the calculated column (`a/b`), can be encapsulated in a [stored function](../../query/functions/user-defined-functions.md). Access the stored function instead of accessing the materialized view directly.

* Cross-cluster/cross-database queries aren't supported.

* References to [external_table()](../../query/externaltablefunction.md) and [externaldata](../../query/externaldata-operator.md) aren't supported.

* In addition to the source table of the view, it may also reference one or more [`dimension tables`](../../concepts/fact-and-dimension-tables.md). Dimension tables must be explicitly called out in the view properties. It is important to understand the behavior when joining with dimension tables:

    * Records in the view's source table (the fact table) are materialized once only. Updates to the dimension tables do not have any impact on records that have already been processed from the fact table. 
    * A different ingestion latency between the fact table and the dimension table may impact the view results.
    * **Example**: A view definition includes an inner join with a dimension table. At the time of materialization, the dimension record was not fully ingested, but was already ingested to the fact table. This record will be dropped from the view and never reprocessed again. 

        Similarly, if the join is an outer join, the record from fact table will be processed and added to view with a null value for the dimension table columns. Records that have already been added (with null values) to the view won't be processed again. Their values, in columns from the dimension table, will remain null.

## Properties

The following are supported in the `with(propertyName=propertyValue)` clause. All properties are optional.

|Property|Type|Description |
|----------------|-------|---|
|backfill|bool|Whether to create the view based on all records currently in *SourceTable* (`true`), or to create it "from-now-on" (`false`). Default is `false`. For more information, see [backfill a materialized view](#backfill-a-materialized-view).| 
|effectiveDateTime|datetime|Relevant only when using `backfill`. If set, creation only backfills with records ingested after the datetime. Backfill must also be set to true. Expects a datetime literal, for example, `effectiveDateTime=datetime(2019-05-01)`|
|UpdateExtentsCreationTime|bool|Relevant only when using `backfill`. If true, [extent creation time](../extents-overview.md#extent-creation-time) is assigned based on datetime group-by key during the backfill process. For more information, see [backfill a materialized view](#backfill-a-materialized-view).
|lookback|timespan| Valid only for `arg_max`/`arg_min`/`any` materialized views, and only if the engine is [EngineV3](../../../engine-v3.md). Limits the period of time in which duplicates are expected. For example, if a look-back of 6 hours is specified on an `arg_max` view, the de-duplication between newly ingested records and existing ones will only take into consideration records that were ingested up to 6 hours ago. Look-back is relative to `ingestion_time`. Defining the look-back period incorrectly may lead to duplicates in the materialized view. For example, if a record for a specific key is ingested 10 hours after a record for the same key was ingested, and the look-back is set to 6h, that key will be a duplicate in the view. The look-back period is applied both during [materialization time](materialized-view-overview.md#how-materialized-views-work) as well as during [query time](materialized-view-overview.md#materialized-views-queries).|
|autoUpdateSchema|bool|Whether to auto-update the view on source table changes. Default is `false`. This option is valid only for views of type `arg_max(Timestamp, *)` / `arg_min(Timestamp, *)` / `any(*)` (only when columns argument is `*`). If this option is set to true, changes to source table will be automatically reflected in the materialized view.
|dimensionTables|Array|A comma-separated list of dimension tables in the view. See [Query argument](#query-argument)
|folder|string|The materialized view's folder.|
|docString|string|A string documenting the materialized view|

> [!WARNING]
> * A materialized view will be automatically disabled by the system if changes to the source table of the materialized view, or changes in data lead to incompatibility between the materialized view query and the expected materialized view's schema.
>   * To avoid this error, the materialized view query must be deterministic. For example, the [bag_unpack](../../query/bag-unpackplugin.md) or [pivot](../../query/pivotplugin.md) plugins result in a non-deterministic schema.
>   * When using an `arg_max(Timestamp, *)` aggregation and when `autoUpdateSchema` is false, changes to the source table can also lead to schema mismatches.
>     * Avoid this failure by defining the view query as `arg_max(Timestamp, Column1, Column2, ...)`, or by using the `autoUpdateSchema` option.
> * Using `autoUpdateSchema` may lead to irreversible data loss when columns in the source table are dropped.
> Monitor automatic disable of materialized views using the [MaterializedViewResult metric](materialized-view-overview.md#materializedviewresult-metric).  After fixing incompatibility issues, re-enable the view with the [enable materialized view](materialized-view-enable-disable.md) command.


## Examples

1. Create an empty arg_max view that will only materialize records ingested from now on:

    <!-- csl -->
    ```
    .create materialized-view ArgMax on table T
    {
        T | summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by User
    }
    ```
    
1. Create a materialized view for daily aggregates with backfill option, using `async`:

    <!-- csl -->
    ```
    .create async materialized-view with (backfill=true, docString="Customer telemetry") CustomerUsage on table T
    {
        T 
        | extend Day = bin(Timestamp, 1d)
        | summarize count(), dcount(User), max(Duration) by Customer, Day 
    } 
    ```
    
1. Create a materialized view with backfill and `effectiveDateTime`. The view is created based on records from the datetime only:

    <!-- csl -->
    ```
    .create async materialized-view with (backfill=true, effectiveDateTime=datetime(2019-01-01)) CustomerUsage on table T 
    {
        T 
        | extend Day = bin(Timestamp, 1d)
        | summarize count(), dcount(User), max(Duration) by Customer, Day
    } 
    ```

1. A materialized view that de-duplicates the source table, based on EventId column, using a look-back of 6h. Records will only be de-duped against records ingested 6 hours prior to current records:

    <!-- csl -->
    ```
    .create materialized-view with(lookback=6h) DedupedT on table T
    {
        T
        | summarize any(*) by EventId
    }
    ```

1. The definition can include additional operators before the `summarize` statement, as long as the `summarize` is the last one:

    <!-- csl -->
    ```
    .create materialized-view CustomerUsage on table T 
    {
        T 
        | where Customer in ("Customer1", "Customer2", "CustomerN")
        | parse Url with "https://contoso.com/" Api "/" *
        | extend Month = startofmonth(Timestamp)
        | summarize count(), dcount(User), max(Duration) by Customer, Api, Month
    }
    ```

1. Materialized views that join with a dimension table:

    <!-- csl -->
    ```
    .create materialized-view with (dimensionTables = ['DimUsers']) EnrichedArgMax on table T
    {
        T
        | lookup DimUsers on User  
        | summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by User 
    }
    
    .create materialized-view with (dimensionTables = ['DimUsers']) EnrichedArgMax on table T 
    {
        DimUsers | project User, Age, Address
        | join kind=rightouter hint.strategy=broadcast T on User
        | summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by User 
    }
    ```

## Performance tips

* Materialized view query filters are optimized when filtered by one of the materialized view group-by keys. If you know your query pattern will often filter by some column, which can be added as a group-by key to the materialized view aggregation, include it in the view. For example: For a materialized view exposing an `arg_max` by `ResourceId` that will often be filtered by `SubscriptionId`, the recommendation is as follows:

    **Do**:
    
    ```kusto
    .create materialized-view ArgMaxResourceId on table FactResources
    {
        FactResources | summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by SubscriptionId, ResouceId 
    }
    ``` 
    
    **Don't do**:
    
    ```kusto
    .create materialized-view ArgMaxResourceId on table FactResources
    {
        FactResources | summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by ResouceId 
    }
    ```

* The materialized view can include transformations, normalizations, and lookups in dimension tables. However, we recommend moving these operations to [update policy](../updatepolicy.md), and leaving only the aggregation for the materialized view.

    **Do**:
    
    * Update policy:
    
    ```kusto
    .alter-merge table Target policy update 
    @'[{"IsEnabled": true, 
        "Source": "SourceTable", 
        "Query": 
            "SourceTable 
            | extend ResourceId = strcat('subscriptions/', toupper(SubscriptionId), '/', resourceId)", 
            | lookup DimResources on ResourceId
        "IsTransactional": false}]'  
    ```
        
    * Materialized View:
    
    ```kusto
    .create materialized-view Usage on table Events
    {
        Target 
        | summarize count() by ResourceId 
    }
    ```
    
    **Don't Do**:
    
    ```kusto
    .create materialized-view Usage on table SourceTable
    {
        SourceTable
        | extend ResourceId = strcat('subscriptions/', toupper(SubscriptionId), '/', resourceId)
        | lookup DimResources on ResourceId
        | summarize count() by ResourceId
    }
    ```
* Define a `lookback` on the view, if applicable. For details, see [properties](#properties). Adding a lookback period to the view can significantly improve query performance.

> [!TIP]
> If you require the best query time performance, but can tolerate some data latency, use the [materialized_view() function](../../query/materialized-view-function.md).

## Backfill a materialized view

When creating a materialized view with the `backfill` property, the materialized view will be created based on the records available in the source table (or a subset of those records, if `effectiveDateTime` is used). Backfill may take a long time to complete for large source tables.

* Using the backfill option is not supported for data in cold cache. Increase the hot cache period, if necessary, for the duration of the view creation. This may require scale-out.

* Behind the scenes, the backfill process splits the data to backfill into multiple batches and uses executes several ingest operations to backfill the view. Transient failures that occur as part of the backfill process are retried, but if all retries are exhausted, a manual re-execution of the create command may be required.

* There are a few properties that you can try changing, if you experience failures in view creation:

    * `MaxSourceRecordsForSingleIngest` - by default, the number of source records in each ingest operation, during backfill, is 2 million records per node. You can change this default by setting this property to the desired number of records (the value is the _total_ number of records in each ingest operation). Decreasing this value can be helpful when creation fails on memory limits / query timeouts. Increasing this value can speed up view creation, assuming the cluster is able to execute the aggregation function on more records than the default.

    * `Concurrency` - the ingest operations, running as part of backfill process, run concurrently. By default, concurrency is `min(number_of_nodes * 2, 5)`. You can set this property to increase/decrease concurrency. Increasing this value is advisable only if cluster's CPU is low, as this can have significant impact on cluster's CPU consumption.

  For example, the following command will backfill the materialized view from `2020-01-01`, with max number of records in each ingest operation of `3 million` records, and will execute the ingest operations with concurrency of `2`: 
    
    <!-- csl -->
    ```
    .create async materialized-view with (
            backfill=true,
            effectiveDateTime=datetime(2019-01-01),
            MaxSourceRecordsForSingleIngest=3000000,
            Concurrency=2
        )
        CustomerUsage on table T
    {
        T
        | summarize count(), dcount(User), max(Duration) by Customer, bin(Timestamp, 1d)
    } 
    ```

* If the materialized view includes a datetime dimension, the backfill process supports overriding the [extent creation time](../extents-overview.md#extent-creation-time) based on the datetime column. This can be useful, for example, if you would like "older" records to be dropped before recent ones, since the [retention policy](../retentionpolicy.md) is based on the extents creation time. Using this property is only supported if the datetime dimension uses the [bin()](../../query/binfunction.md) function. For example, the following backfill will assign creation time based on the `Timestamp` group-by key: 

   <!-- csl -->
    ```
    .create async materialized-view with (
            backfill=true,
            UpdateExtentsCreationTime=true
        )
        CustomerUsage on table T
    {
        T
        | summarize count() by Customer, bin(Timestamp, 1d)
    } 
    ```

## Materialized views limitations and known issues

* A materialized view can't be created:
    * On top of another materialized view.
    * On [follower databases](../../../follower.md). Follower databases are read-only and materialized views require write operations.  Materialized views that are defined on leader databases can be queried from their followers, like any other table in the leader.
* A materialized view only processes new records ingested into the source table. Records which are removed from the source table, either by running [data purge](../../concepts/data-purge.md)/[drop extents](../drop-extents.md), or due to [retention policy](../retentionpolicy.md) or any other reason, have no impact on the materialized view. The materialized view has its own [retention policy](materialized-view-policies.md#retention-and-caching-policy), which is independent of the retention policy of the source table. The materialized view might include records which are not present in the source table.
* The source table of a materialized view:
    * Must be a table that is being ingested to directly, either using one of the [ingestion methods](../../../ingest-data-overview.md#ingestion-methods-and-tools), using an [update policy](../updatepolicy.md), or [ingest from query commands](../data-ingestion/ingest-from-query.md).
        * Specifically, using [move extents](../move-extents.md) from other tables into the source table of the materialized view is not supported. Move extents may fail with the following error: `Cannot drop/move extents from/to table 'TableName' since Materialized View 'ViewName' is currently processing some of these extents`.
    * Must have [IngestionTime policy](../ingestiontimepolicy.md) enabled (the default is enabled).
    * Can't be enabled for [streaming ingestion](../streamingingestionpolicy.md). Materialized views over streaming ingestion tables are supported in preview mode. Enabling this feature on your cluster requires [creating a support ticket](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Support).
    * Can't be a table with [restricted view access policy](../restrictedviewaccesspolicy.md).
* [Cursor functions](../databasecursor.md#cursor-functions) can't be used on top of materialized views.
* Continuous export from a materialized view isn't supported.

## Cancel materialized-view creation

Cancel the process of materialized view creation when using the `backfill` option. This action is useful when creation is taking too long and you want to abort it while running.  

> [!WARNING]
> The materialized view can't be restored after running this command.

The creation process can't be aborted immediately. The cancel command signals materialization to stop, and the creation periodically checks if cancel was requested. The cancel command waits for a max period of 10 minutes until the materialized view creation process is canceled and reports back if cancellation was successful. Even if the cancellation didn't succeed within 10 minutes, and the cancel command reports failure, the materialized view will most probably abort itself later in the creation process. The [`.show operations`](../operations.md#show-operations) command will indicate if operation was canceled. The `cancel operation` command is only supported for materialized views creation cancellation, and not for canceling any other operations.

### Syntax

`.cancel` `operation` *operationId*

### Properties

|Property|Type|Description
|----------------|-------|---|
|operationId|Guid|The operation ID returned from the create materialized-view command.|

### Output

|Output parameter |Type |Description
|---|---|---
|OperationId|Guid|The operation ID of the create materialized view command.
|Operation|String|Operation kind.
|StartedOn|datetime|The start time of the create operation.
|CancellationState|string|One of - `Cancelled successfully` (creation was canceled), `Cancellation failed` (wait for cancellation timed out), `Unknown` (view creation is no longer running, but wasn't canceled by this operation).
|ReasonPhrase|string|Reason why cancellation wasn't successful.

### Example

<!-- csl -->
```
.cancel operation c4b29441-4873-4e36-8310-c631c35c916e
```

|OperationId|Operation|StartedOn|CancellationState|ReasonPhrase|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|c4b29441-4873-4e36-8310-c631c35c916e|MaterializedViewCreateOrAlter|2020-05-08 19:45:03.9184142|Canceled successfully||

If the cancellation hasn't completed within 10 minutes, `CancellationState` will indicate failure. Creation may then be aborted.
